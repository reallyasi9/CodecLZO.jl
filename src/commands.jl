"""
    struct LiteralCopyCommand <: AbstractCommand

An encoded command representing a copy of a number of bytes from input straight to output.

In LZO1X, literal copies come in three varieties:

## Long copies

LZO1X long copy commands begin with a byte with four high zero bits and four low potentially non-zero bits:

    0 0 0 0 L L L L

The low four bits represent the length of the copy _minus three_. This can obviously only represent copies of length 3 to 18, so to encode longer copies, LZO1X uses the following encoding method:

1. If the first byte is non-zero, then `length = 3 + L`
2. If the first byte is zero, then `length = 18 + (number of zero bytes after the first) Ã— 255 + (first non-zero byte)`

This means a length of 18 is encoded as `[0b00001111]`, a length of 19 is encoded as `[0b00000000, 0b00000001]`, a length of 274 is encoded as `[0b00000000, 0b00000000, 0b00000001]`, and so on.

## Short copies

The long copy command cannot encode copies shorter than four bytes by design. If a literal of three or fewer bytes needs to be copied, it is encoded in the two least significant bits of the previous history lookback copy command. This works because literal copies and history lookback copies always alternate in LZO1X streams.

## First literal copies

LZO1X streams always begin with a literal copy command of at least four bytes. Because the first command is always a literal copy, a special format is used to copy runs of literals that are between 18 and 238 bytes that compacts the command into a single byte. If the first byte of the stream has the following values, they are interpreted as the corresponding literal copy commands:

- `0:15`: Treat as a "long copy" encoding (see above).
- `17:255`: Treat as a copy of `(byte - 17)` literals.

Note that `17:20` are invalid values for a first copy command in LZO1X streams because history lookback copy lengths must always be four or more bytes. A value of `16` in the first position is always invalid.

!!! note
    The official `liblzo2` version of LZO1X properly _decodes_ these first literal copy codes, but never _encodes_ them when compressing data.

    struct HistoryCopyCommand <: AbstractCommand

An encoded command representing a copy of a number of bytes from the already produced output back to the output.

In LZO1X, history lookback copies come in five varieties, the format of which is determined by the number of bytes copied, the lookback distance, and whether or not the previous command had a short literal copy tagged on the end:

## Very short copy, short distance

Copies of three to four bytes with a lookback distance within 2048 bytes are encoded as two bytes, with bits encoding the length and distance. The command is to be interpreted in the following way (MSB first):

    `01LDDDSS HHHHHHHH`

This means copy `3 + 0bL` from a distance of `0b00000HHH_HHHHHDDD + 1`.

The last two bits of the MSB instruct the decoder to copy `0bSS` literals from the input to the output immediately following the history lookback copy.

## Short copy, short distance

Copies of five to eight bytes with a lookback distance within 2048 bytes are encoded as two bytes, with bits encoding the length and distance. The command is to be interpreted in the following way (MSB first):

    `1LLDDDSS HHHHHHHH`

This means copy `5 + 0bLL` bytes from a distance of `0b00000HHH_HHHHHDDD + 1`.

The last two bits of the MSB instruct the decoder to copy 0 through 3 literals from the input to the output immediately following the history lookback copy.

## Any length copy, short to medium distance

Copies of any length greater than two with a lookback distance within 16384 bytes is incoded with at least three bytes and with as many as necessary to encode the run length. The command is to be interpreted in the following way (MSB first):

    `001LLLLL [Z zero bytes] [XXXXXXXX] EEEEEESS DDDDDDDD`

The lower five bits of the first byte represent the length of the copy _minus two_. This can obviously only represent copies of length 2 to 33, so to encode longer copies, LZO1X uses the following encoding method:

1. If `0bLLLLL` is non-zero, then `length = 2 + 0bLLLLL`
2. If `0bLLLLL` is zero, then `length = 33 + (number of zero bytes after the first) Ã— 255 + (first non-zero byte)`

The lookback distance is encoded in LE order in the last two bytes: that is, the last byte of the command holds the MSB of the distance, and the second-to-last byte holds the LSB of the distance. The distance is interpreted as `distance = 0b00DDDDDD_DDEEEEEE + 1`.

The last two bits of the second-to-last byte instruct the decoder to copy `0bSS` literals from the input to the output immediately following the history lookback copy.

## Any length copy, long distance

Copies of any length greater than two with a lookback distance between 16385 and 49151 bytes is incoded with at least three bytes and with as many as necessary to encode the run length. The command is to be interpreted in the following way (MSB first):

    `0001HLLL [Z zero bytes] [XXXXXXXX] EEEEEESS DDDDDDDD`

As with other variable length runs,, LZO1X uses the following encoding method with this command:

1. If `0bLLL` is non-zero, then `length = 2 + 0bLLL`
2. If `0bLLL` is zero, then `length = 9 + (number of zero bytes after the first) Ã— 255 + (first non-zero byte)`

The lookback distance is encoded with one bit in the first command byte (`H`), then in LE order in the last two bytes: that is, the last byte of the command holds the MSB of the distance, and the second-to-last byte holds the LSB of the distance. The distance is interpreted as `distance = 16384 + 0b0HDDDDDD_DDEEEEEE`.

The last two bits of the second-to-last byte instruct the decoder to copy `0bSS` literals from the input to the output immediately following the history lookback copy.

!!! info "Special End-of-Stream Encoding"
    End-of-stream is signaled by a history lookback copy of 3 bytes from a distance of 16384 bytes with no subsequent literal copies. This corresponds to a long historical lookback copy command of `0b00010001 0b00000000 0b00000000`.

!!! note
    The maximum lookback distance that LZO1X can encode is `16384 + 0b01111111_11111111 == 49151` bytes.

## Short copies from short distances following literal copies

If the previous history lookback command included a short literal copy (`1 â‰¤ 0bSS â‰¤ 3`, as encoded in the above commands), then a special two-byte command can be used to copy two bytes with a lookback distance within 1024 bytes. The command is to be interpreted in the following way (MSB first):

    `0000DDSS HHHHHHHH`

The number of bytes to copy is always `length = 2`, and the lookback distance is `0b000000HH_HHHHHHDD + 1`.

The last two bits of the first byte instruct the decoder to copy `0bSS` literals from the input to the output immediately following the history lookback copy.

If the previous command was a long literal copy (of four of more bytes), then the same two-byte command means something different: it encodes a three-byte copy with a lookback distance between 2049 and 3071 bytes. The command is interpreted the same as above, but `length = 3` and `distance = 0b000000HH_HHHHHHDD + 2049`.

!!! note
    Because encoding these special commands require a historical match of fewer than four bytes, they are never _encoded_ by the LZO1X algorithm: however, they are valid LZO1X commands, and the LZO1X _decoder_ will interpret them correctly.

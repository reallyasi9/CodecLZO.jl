The C library version claims to use only a 4096-byte hash map as additional working memory, but it also requires that a continuous space in memory be available to hold the entire output of the compressed data, the length of which is not knowable a priori but can be larger than the uncompressed data by a factor of roughly 256/255. This implementation needs to keep 49151 bytes of input history in memory in addition to the 4096-byte hash map, but only expands the output as necessary during compression.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#CodecLZO.count_matching-Union{Tuple{T}, Tuple{AbstractVector{T}, AbstractVector{T}}} where T","page":"Home","title":"CodecLZO.count_matching","text":"count_matching(a::AbstractVector, b::AbstractVector)\n\nCount the number of elements at the start of a that match the elements at the start of b.\n\nEquivalent to findfirst(a .!= b), but faster and limiting itself to the first min(length(a), length(b)) elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#CodecLZO.encode_run!-Tuple{Union{TranscodingStreams.Memory, AbstractVector{UInt8}}, Int64, Int64, Int64}","page":"Home","title":"CodecLZO.encode_run!","text":"n_written = encode_run(output, start_index, len, bits)\n\nEmit the number of zero bytes necessary to encode a length len in a command expecting bits leading bits.\n\nLiteral and copy lengths are always encoded as either a single byte or a sequence of three or more bytes. If len < (1 << bits), the length will be encoded in the lower bits bits of the starting byte of output so the return will be 0. Otherwise, the return will be the number of additional bytes needed to encode the length. The returned number of bytes does not include the zeros in the first byte (the command) used to signal that a run encoding follows, but it does include the remainder.\n\nNote: the argument len is expected to be the adjusted length for the command. Literals use an adjusted length of len = length(literal) - 3 and copy commands use an adjusted literal length of len = length(copy) - 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#CodecLZO.multiplicative_hash-Union{Tuple{T}, Tuple{T, Integer, Int64}} where T<:Integer","page":"Home","title":"CodecLZO.multiplicative_hash","text":"multiplicative_hash(value, magic_number, bits, [mask::V = typemax(UInt64)])\n\nHash value into a type V using multiplicative hashing.\n\nThis method performs floor((value * magic_number % W) / (W / M)) where W = 2^64, M = 2^m, and magic_number is relatively prime to W, is large, and has a good mix of 1s and 0s in its binary representation.
